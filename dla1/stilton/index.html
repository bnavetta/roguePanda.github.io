            <p>"We shall miss our excellent friend," I remarked, with a deep sigh.</p>
            <p><span class="effect effect-laugh">"Bah!"</span> said my uncle testily, "what matters it? That or another, it is all the same."</p>
            <p>I thought the remark ungrateful, and felt almost inclined to say so; but I forbore.</p>
            <p>
                At this moment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spectacle. After we had gone about five hundred
                yards, we suddenly turned a steep promontory, and found ourselves close to a lofty forest! It consisted of
                straight trunks with tufted tops, in shape like parasols. The air seemed to have no effect upon these
                trees — which in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hastened forward. I could find no name for these singular formations. Did they not belong to the two
                thousand and more known trees—or were we to make the discovery of a new growth? By no means. When we at last
                reached the forest, and stood beneath the trees, my surprise gave way to admiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In truth, I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth, of singular and gigantic
                proportions. My uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names.
            </p>
            <p>"It is only," he said, in his coolest manner, "a forest of mushrooms."</p>
            <p>
                On close examination I found that he was not mistaken. Judge of the development attained by this product of
                damp hot soils. I had heard that the Lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in circumference, but here were
                white mushrooms, nearly forty feet high, and with tops of equal dimensions. They grew in countless
                thousands—the light could not make its way through their massive substance, and beneath them reigned a
                gloomy and mystic darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still I wished to go forward. The cold in the shades of this singular forest was intense. For nearly an hour
                we wandered about in this visible darkness. At length I left the spot, and once more returned to the shores
                of the lake, to light and comparative warmth.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the amazing vegetation of subterraneous land was not confined to gigantic mushrooms. New wonders awaited
                us at every step. We had not gone many hundred yards, when we came upon a mighty group of other trees with
                discolored leaves—the common humble trees of Mother Earth, of an exorbitant and phenomenal size: lycopods a
                hundred feet high; flowering ferns as tall as pines; gigantic grasses!
            </p>
            <p>
                "Astonishing, magnificent, splendid!" cried my uncle; "here we have before us the whole flora of the second
                period of the world, that of transition. Behold the humble plants of our gardens, which in the first ages of
                the world were mighty trees. Look around you, my dear Harry. No botanist ever before gazed on such a sight!"
            </p>
            <p>My uncle's enthusiasm, always a little more than was required, was now excusable.</p>
